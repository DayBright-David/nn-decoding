This repository contains analysis code for the paper:

*Does the brain represent words? An evaluation of brain decoding studies of language understanding.* {Jon Gauthier and Anna Ivanova}. Submitted to CCN 2018.

## Repository structure

Our results can be reproduced with the following steps:

1. Use `fetch_data.sh` to fetch the data from Pereira et al. (2018), shared on OSF.
2. Use `learn_decoder.py` to learn decoders from subject fMRI data to each of the target representations (stored in the `encodings` directory).
3. Use `analysis.ipynb` to collect decoder results and generate analyses / graphs (Figure 2).
4. Use `heatmap.py` to build the model regression heatmap (Figure 3).

Target encodings (in the `encodings` directory) were generated by running each of the encoding models on the 384 sentences in `data/384sentences.txt` (downloaded with `fetch_data.sh`). All encoding models here were open-source, and most are shipped with pretrained weights. Scripts and more information about generating these encoding files are available upon request.
